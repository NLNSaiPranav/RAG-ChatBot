Plaksha University is a not-for-profit private research university located in Mohali, Punjab, India.[2] It was founded by businessmen and technology entrepreneurs with a mission to create a new model of higher education that combines academic excellence with industrial relevance. It is a corporate-funded technical university, which is being established under the Punjab State Private Universities Policy of 2010. It has received a Letter of Intent from the Government of Punjab.

It was founded in 2019 by a group of industry leaders and entrepreneurs. The university is named after the Plaksha tree, which is considered sacred in Indian mythology and symbolizes knowledge and growth. The university's logo also features the tree, with its branches reaching outwards to represent its commitment to expanding knowledge and creating a positive impact.

Plaksha University offers undergraduate and graduate programs in engineering, computer science, data science, and entrepreneurship.

The university began its Undergraduate program in September 2021. 

In addition to academic programs, Plaksha University has established several research centers focused on cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and sustainable energy. These centers bring together leading researchers and industry experts to collaborate on projects that address some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.

The 50-acre campus is being built in Sector 101 A near the Chandigarh International Airport

Plaksha's journey started in 2015, as a conversation among a few friends about how and why technology education needs to change. This group of people, most of them entrepreneurs and business leaders, were keen to change the landscape of engineering and technology education in India and the world. Reimagining Higher Education Foundation, a Section 8 not-for-profit company, was set up in 2017 with a mission of converting the idea into a plan. In Feb 2019, the groundbreaking of Plaksha University's campus in Mohali took place with the aim of opening the campus in Aug 2021.

B.Tech in Robotics & Cyber-Physical Systems
Solutions to grand challenges increasingly require reaching across the boundaries of the cyber, physical & human worlds. The Robotics & Cyber-Physical Systems program is different from traditional electrical & mechanical engineering programs & is designed to target the growing & unmet need at the intersection of computing, mechatronics, & human behavior. Students will be able to design engineering systems that interact with humans & environment & create solutions to tackle some of India’s & the world’s most pressing grand challenges.

B.Tech in Biological Systems Engineering
The Biological Systems Engineering program combines the power of biology, computing & engineering to tackle some of the greatest challenges for human & planetary health. Our population’s health is dominated by various diseases, & are exacerbated by major risk factors such as air pollution, malnutrition & vast regional differences in health care services. The vision for the BSE program is to transform health outcomes for the world, by leveraging the powerful convergence of data, digital health, biologics manufacturing & biology.

B.Tech in Data Science, Economics & Business
This cutting-edge interdisciplinary degree is at the nexus of data science and understanding of humans, economy, businesses and government. The Data Science, Economics & Business program has a strong core in data science, which is blended with a study of how humans think, behave and make decisions, how our society works and how global economic and financial markets operate. Students will be encouraged to explore the real-world applications that emerge at these intersections to create solutions and value for the economy and society.

Student journey
The program has been designed to develop academic depth as well as skill sets and mindsets that will stay with the students through their life, irrespective of the career paths they choose. In each of their 4 years, students will be required to take a few core classes (across disciplines), as well as choose electives in various fields of study.

Summer Program | Grade 9 - 12
Young Technology Scholars
Young Technology Scholars (YTS) is a two-week intensive summer program where students are exposed to real-world engineering and problem-solving.
